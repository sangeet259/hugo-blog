There are some features in sublime that I absolutely love.

Three of them :
1. `ctrl + P` : Opens up a input field where you can search for files across the entire project.
2. `ctrl + R` : Search for a method/function in the current opened file.
3. `ctrl + shift + R` : Search for method/function across the entire project.
