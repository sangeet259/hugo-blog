Soon after I landed my internship, the task of having to manage my own money was an exciting challenge.
This set me off through rabbit hole of blogs and YouTube videos. This was a fun and enlightening exercise. It's been 7 months now, into my first full time job.

I thought of condensing all my learnings and practices into this post. Even if you don't find them helpful, I hope you have a direction to think about managing your own money.

The important thing here is discipline.

As Morgan Housel puts it, `Your behaviour with money is more important than how intelligent you are`.

Now coming back to the topic, I break down my personal finance into 5 topics:
* Insurance 
* Savings
* Investment
* Taxes

I didn't put retirement up there, because that will be included in Investment.

# Insurance
This is the first and most important topic that one should tackle when they start earning. Try and get these two insurances as soon as you can:
* Health Insurance
* Life Insurance (Term Insurance)

### Health Insurance
Health Insurance is a ciritical part of your financial toolkit. In brief, it's the guarantee of payment for your medical expenses that an insurance company gives in exchange for a regular guaranteed premium paid by you.

While you maybe healthy now, nobody knows what tomorrow holds, I cannot stress enough, based on my personal experiences, how important it is to have a good health insurance.

Now the questions is which insurance and how to get one.
I would strongly recommend you to give this section a read to understand what different terms in a health insurance mean: [Health Insurance 101](https://joinditto.in/health-insurance/articles/health-insurance-101)


And check out this checklit of features in your health insurance: [Checklist](https://joinditto.in/health-insurance/checklist/).

You can a get a good health insurance at an annual premium Rs. 8,000, with a cover of 7.5 to 10 Lacs.

**Where to get?**

I prefer [Policy Bazaar](https://www.policybazaar.com/), the agents there are really good, you just need to tell them your requirements, (*see the Checklist which I linked above*).
