Soon after I landed my internship, the thought of having to manage my own money was an exciting challenge.
This set me off through rabbit hole of blogs and YouTube videos. Time passed, and now I am 7 months into my first full time job.

I thought of condensing all my learnings and practices into a series of highly opinionated posts. Even if you don't find them helpful, I hope you have a direction to think about managing your own money.

The important thing here is discipline.

As Morgan Housel puts it, "Your behaviour with money is more important than how intelligent you are".
