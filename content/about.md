ðŸ‘‹ Bonjour Visitor!<br>

I am Sangeet and I work as a Quant in JP Morgan Chase and Co. in Mumbai.
My interest lies in Programming, Data Science and Quantitative Finance.<br>
I hail from Jajpur, Odisha. I did my schooling in Bokaro and Bhubaneswar before getting into IIT Kharagpur in July 2016.

</p>

I am fuelled by the passion of understanding by trying and breaking things. Thatâ€™s helps me become a better programmer and my quest for analytical understanding drives my Data Science and Finance skills.

In my time at IIT Kharagpur, I have been at Kharagpur Open Source Society, being the Executive Head for the session 2018-19. I have also served at the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, where I got to learn a lot about Image Processing, Computer Vision and Deep Learning . I have been a part AgNext and SIP Labs IIT KGP as Deep Learning Practitioner. I have also tinkered with Version Control Systems during my time as he Google Summer of Code student developer with the Mercurial (Python Software Foundation).

On the lighter side, I love trivia/quizzing. Politics and biz is my forte, I suck at Pop/Sp-Ent. Badminton is my go-to sport. I love playing guitar.<br>

In my free time I watch movies, you can checkout my movie profile here on [LetterBoxd:](http://letterboxd.com/sangeet259).<br>
I read some non-fiction, but havenâ€™t got much head into that field.[GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/sangeet259)<br>
